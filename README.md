# Monty-Hall-Sim 
When run, code simulates the Monty Hall problem n times (currently 100,000) and tracks every time switching would result in a win.
This program is meant to demonstrate why the Monty Hall problem works, hence some unnecessary complication like switch = random.randint(2,3) on line 9, where both integers would have the same effect (a loss).
